===============================================================================================
	APPLICATION : Geometric Transformation Technique for Total Hip Implant
===============================================================================================

This file contains a summary of what you will find in each of the files that
make up our application.

System Requirements:
	-To run the jar set path to the jdk/bin as environment variable,i.e. javaw.exe should be visible to the computer
	-The images back.jpg and hip.jpg should be in the same folder as the CompGraphProject.jar file

CompGraphProject.jar:
	-This is the main application the user needs to launch after downloading it.
	-The digital hip implant with the X- ray image in the background will be shown. 
	-The user can translate the implant to the required place with the mouse.
	-The size of the implant can be scaled as per the requirement by providing 
	 appropiate scaling factor in the textfield.
	-After scaling, the hip implant can be adjusted in the right place by providing
	 the angle in degrees.
	-Mirror button will be used to reflect the implant about y axis.
	-Scaling and Rotation are relative to their previous values.

CompGraphProject.java:
	-This is the application source code file.
	-Contains the code to run the application.
